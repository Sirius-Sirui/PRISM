I am a PhD student at the Teachers College, Columbia University, advised by [Prof. Andrew M Gordon] (https://example.com](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/ag275/).

Prior to this, I obtained a BEng degree in Central South University, China. And obtained an MRes degree in Bioengineering in Imperial College London.

My current research focuses on building up an open source database for human being on dexterous manipulation for commonly used objects.
