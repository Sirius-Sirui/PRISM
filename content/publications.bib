Abstract = {Most cases of unilateral knee osteoarthritis (OA) progress to bilateral
   OA within 10 years. Biomechanical asymmetries have been implicated in
   contralateral OA development; however, gait analysis alone does not
   consistently detect asymmetries in OA patient gait. Stair ambulation is
   a more demanding activity that may be more suited to reveal between-leg
   asymmetries in OA patients. The objective of this study was to
   investigate the between-leg biomechanical differences in patients with
   unilateral mild-to-moderate knee OA. Sixteen unilateral mild-to-moderate
   medial knee OA patients and 16 healthy individuals underwent kinematic
   and kinetic analysis of stair ascent and descent. Stair ascent produced
   higher loading and muscle forces in the unaffected limb compared to the
   OA limb, and stair descent produced lower loading on the OA limb
   compared to healthy subjects. These biomechanical differences were
   apparent in the ankle, knee, and hip joints. The implications of these
   findings are that OA patients rely more heavily on their unaffected
   sides than the affected side in stair ascent, a strategy that may be
   detrimental to the unaffected joint health. The reduction in affected
   limb loading in stair descent is thought to be related to minimizing
   pain.},
